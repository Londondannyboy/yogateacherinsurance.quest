          <p className="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            One of the most common points of confusion for yoga teachers is understanding the difference between public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance. Many teachers mistakenly believe these terms are interchangeable or that having one covers the risks of the other. In reality, they protect against completely different types of claims and are both essential for comprehensive protection.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Understanding this distinction isn't just academic—it's critical for ensuring you have adequate protection. A claim covered by professional indemnity wouldn't be covered by public liability insurance alone, and vice versa. Let's break down exactly what each covers and why you need both.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Public Liability Insurance: The Basics</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Public liability insurance protects you against claims from third parties who claim you caused them physical injury, death, or property damage through negligence or breach of your legal duty of care. In simpler terms, it covers "accidents" rather than "professional mistakes."
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">What Public Liability Covers</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Public liability insurance specifically covers:

            Imagine these scenarios in your yoga studio:

          <ul className="space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-300">
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-indigo-400 font-bold">1.</span>
              <span><strong>The slip:</strong> A student exits your hot yoga class, slips on the wet bathroom floor you neglected to mop properly, and fractures their ankle. Public liability covers this.</span>

            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-indigo-400 font-bold">2.</span>
              <span><strong>The falling equipment:</strong> A yoga block falls from a shelf you overstuffed and hits a student on the head, requiring emergency room treatment. Public liability covers this.</span>

              <span className="text-indigo-400 font-bold">3.</span>

              <span className="text-indigo-400 font-bold">4.</span>

          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Professional Indemnity Insurance: The Basics</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Professional indemnity insurance (also called professional liability insurance) covers claims that your professional advice, instruction, or treatment caused harm to a client. The emphasis here is on your professional expertise—what you advised or instructed them to do, not on accidents or environmental hazards.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For yoga teachers, professional indemnity covers claims that your instruction caused physical harm, based on the assumption that you gave bad advice or failed to properly assess the student's capabilities and limitations.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">What Professional Indemnity Covers</h4>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The key point: Public liability and professional indemnity cover different types of risk. A claim might fall into either category or even both, but you can't rely on one type to cover what the other doesn't.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Coverage Amounts and Limits</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Both types of insurance come with maximum coverage limits. Understanding these limits helps you understand your protection level:
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Typical Yoga Teacher Coverage Limits</h4>

          <ul className="space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-300">
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">•</span>
              <span><strong>Public Liability:</strong> Usually £1-10 million per claim (£1 million is most common for yoga teachers)</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">•</span>
              <span><strong>Professional Indemnity:</strong> Usually £1-6 million per claim (£6 million is standard for yoga teachers)</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            These limits might seem high, but serious injury claims can be substantial. A permanent spinal injury might be valued at £500,000-£2,000,000 depending on severity and age of the injured party. Head injuries can exceed these amounts. Understanding your coverage limits helps you assess whether your insurance is adequate for your specific situation.

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When shopping for yoga teacher insurance, look for policies that explicitly include BOTH:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-3 mb-6 text-slate-300">

              <span>Professional Indemnity Insurance (minimum £6 million)</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most yoga teacher insurance policies bundle these together as a comprehensive professional package. When comparing quotes, always verify:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-300">
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-blue-400 font-bold">✓</span>
              <span>Both public liability AND professional indemnity are included</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Conclusion</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Public liability and professional indemnity insurance serve different but equally important purposes in protecting your yoga teaching career. Public liability protects against accidents and environmental hazards; professional indemnity protects against claims related to your instruction and professional judgment. You need both.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            When you purchase yoga teacher insurance, make sure you're getting a comprehensive policy that includes both types of coverage. Review your policy annually to ensure both components are maintained and that coverage limits remain appropriate for your evolving practice.
