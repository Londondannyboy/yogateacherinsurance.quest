          <p className="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            If you're currently enrolled in a yoga teacher training program, you're likely thinking about whether you need insurance. This is an important question because even as a student still in training, you may be teaching other trainees, friends, or family members during practice sessions—situations where insurance becomes essential protection.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The key insight: Your yoga school's insurance probably doesn't cover your personal practice teaching. If you injure someone while you're teaching them yoga, even as a trainee, they could claim against you personally. Trainee-specific insurance exists specifically for this situation and costs very little.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Does Your Yoga Training Course Include Insurance?</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            First, check whether your yoga training course includes insurance. Some training programs do include basic coverage for students, though this varies widely by school and course type.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Insurance Included in Course Fees</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some yoga schools, particularly Yoga Alliance accredited programs, include professional insurance in course fees. This coverage typically extends to:
          </p>

          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6 text-slate-300">
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-green-400 font-bold">✓</span>
              <span>Practice teaching during the course (teaching other trainees)</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-green-400 font-bold">✓</span>
              <span>Supervised teaching as part of curriculum</span>
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-start gap-3">
              <span className="text-green-400 font-bold">✓</span>
              <span>Liability if you accidentally injure someone during practice teaching</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            However, even if your course includes insurance, the coverage typically expires when your course finishes. Additionally, it may not cover unsupervised practice teaching outside the course structure.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Insurance NOT Included in Course Fees</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Many yoga teacher training programs—particularly shorter weekend courses, online programs, or independent instructors—do not include insurance in their fees. If your course falls into this category, you need to obtain your own trainee insurance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Why Trainee Yoga Teachers Need Insurance</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Even as a trainee not yet fully qualified, you face real liability risks if you're teaching yoga to anyone—whether it's other trainees, friends, family, or anyone in a practice class. Consider these scenarios:
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Practice Teaching During Course</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most yoga training courses require students to teach practice classes, either to other trainees or to the general public. During these practice sessions, you're teaching professionally, even though you're still learning. If someone is injured, they can claim against you even though you're a trainee.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Teaching Friends and Family</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Many trainees start teaching friends and family while still in training. Even casual teaching can create liability. If your friend claims that a pose you taught them caused back pain, you're potentially liable for damages—and you need insurance to protect yourself.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Private Student Sessions</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some trainees offer private lessons while completing their training. Private sessions create even higher liability risks because you have one-on-one responsibility. Without insurance, you're personally exposed to any injury claim.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Trainee vs. Professional Yoga Insurance</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Getting Trainee Yoga Insurance</h3>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Trainee yoga insurance is straightforward to obtain:
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Ask Your Training Provider First</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Check whether your yoga training school includes insurance in course fees or recommends specific providers. Many schools have established relationships with insurers and can provide group discounts to their students.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Check If You Qualify for Group Rates</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some insurers offer group discounts for students of specific yoga schools. These can reduce costs by 20-30%, making insurance even more affordable.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3 mt-6">Compare Individual Trainee Policies</h4>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            If no group coverage is available, compare trainee-specific policies from yoga insurance specialists. Many offer policies specifically designed for students and trainees with appropriate coverage levels and affordable pricing.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Being a trainee yoga teacher doesn't exempt you from liability if you teach and someone gets injured. Even though you're still learning, you have a responsibility to protect those you teach. Trainee insurance is affordable, appropriate for your current situation, and ensures you're properly protected while you complete your training.
          </p>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            Plan to transition from trainee insurance to professional insurance as you complete your training and begin your professional yoga teaching career. This straightforward progression ensures continuous protection as your teaching progresses from student practice to professional practice.
