                While not legally required by UK law, yoga teacher insurance is highly recommended for professional protection. Most yoga studios require teachers to have liability insurance, and Yoga Alliance register members are strongly advised to carry professional indemnity and public liability cover. Insurance protects you against potential claims from students and provides essential financial protection for your teaching business.

                Yes, yoga studio owners typically need more comprehensive insurance than independent teachers. Studio insurance should cover all teachers working at the studio, property damage, equipment, and employer's liability. Studio owners should also ensure they have adequate public liability coverage for the increased foot traffic and potential injury risks. Many insurers offer specific studio-owner policies designed to provide comprehensive protection for the entire business.
